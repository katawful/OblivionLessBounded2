# OblivionLessBounded2

Oblivion Less Bounded is an attempt to mimic the Skyrim mod "Skyrim Unbound". The Skyrim mod lets
you adjust your character, from the start location to if you want to do the main quest, to what
guilds you are a part of. It does this while also allowing you to set up whatever mods you want to
set up, which is a massive time saver if you want to constantly restart. As well, there is a good
menu to handle all this, but this mod also doesn't *require* you to do any of this. You can just
press a preset and call it a day. This Oblivion mod attempts to mimic these features, while keeping
the vibes of Oblivion in mind.

# Why Two?
I originally started this mod in 2020. I was much newer to modding, and had little idea how to
handle mod this complex. As well, since I wanted a menu to control all this I had to figure out how
to create and handle this. This ate up 3 years of my time, and in that time I put 0 work into
OblivionLessBounded. This both led to bitrot, but also me disliking everything I worked on.
